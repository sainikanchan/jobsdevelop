# Company Slug Directory

> A curated list of verified company slugs organized by ATS platform. Use these with the `companySlug` parameter to search jobs at specific companies.

**Last Updated:** 2026-06-04

## Usage

```bash
# Search Greenhouse jobs for Stripe
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/jobs/search \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"companySlug": "stripe", "siteType": ["greenhouse"]}'

# Search all ATS platforms for Spotify (auto-detect)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/jobs/search \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"companySlug": "spotify"}'

# CLI usage
npm run cli -- search --company-slug stripe --site greenhouse
```

When `companySlug` is provided without `siteType`, all 41 ATS scrapers run concurrently and return results from whichever platform the company uses.

| AXSOL | `axsol` | Power / Energy Storage |

## Oracle HCM Cloud

Oracle slugs follow the `<subdomain>-<region>` form (e.g. `eeho-us2`) — they expand into the canonical career-portal URL `https://<subdomain>.fa.<region>.oraclecloud.com`. For multi-segment subdomains like `careers-portal-us2`, the resolver splits on the LAST `-` (`subdomain=careers-portal`, `region=us2`). Operators with a non-default `siteNumber` finder parameter pass it via `ScraperInputDto.siteNumber` (defaults to `'CX_45001'` per Q-030). Slugs sampled from the upstream `OTHERS/Ats-scrapers/oracle/oracle_companies.csv` reference list — the corpus is dominated by enterprises across financial services, retail, healthcare, and government.

| Company | Slug | Industry |
| ------- | ---- | -------- |
| Oracle | `eeho-us2` | Enterprise Software |
| City of Atlanta | `ehxr-us2` | Government |
| TTX | `ejjc-us6` | Rail / Logistics |
| CooperCompanies | `hcjy-us2` | Healthcare / MedTech |
| EXP | `elcn-us2` | Engineering Consulting |
| Kroll | `hcxs-us2` | Risk / Financial Advisory |
| Macy's | `ebwh-us2` | Retail |
| Westpac Group | `ebuu-ap1` | Banking |
| DTCC | `ebxr-us2` | Financial Infrastructure |
| Hologic | `ebwb-us2` | Medical Devices |
| Mountaire | `ebtg-us2` | Food / Poultry |
| Mouser | `eabw-us2` | Electronics Distribution |
| Ricoh | `cbha-us2` | Imaging / Technology |
| Galliford Try | `cbct-em2` | Construction |
| Apollo Hospitals | `cgs-ap2` | Healthcare |

## Mercor

Mercor is a **catalogue-wide** scraper — the explore-page endpoint returns the entire public listing set in one GET, with no per-company URL segmentation. The "slug" passed via `ScraperInputDto.companySlug` is therefore a **case-insensitive substring filter** on `companyName` rather than a URL-keyed identifier. Empty slug returns the full catalogue (capped by `resultsWanted`, default 100); populated slug narrows the result via `companyName.toLowerCase().includes(slug.toLowerCase())`. Sample employers below are taken from the explore-page corpus at time of writing — Mercor's catalogue is fluid, so the list evolves as companies post and close roles.

| Company | Slug | Industry |
| ------- | ---- | -------- |
| Stripe | `stripe` | Payments |
| OpenAI | `openai` | AI / Foundation Models |
| Anthropic | `anthropic` | AI / Foundation Models |
| Notion | `notion` | Productivity SaaS |
| Airbnb | `airbnb` | Travel / Marketplace |
| Figma | `figma` | Design Tools |
| Vercel | `vercel` | Developer Infrastructure |
| Linear | `linear` | Productivity / DevTools |
| Discord | `discord` | Social / Communication |
| Coinbase | `coinbase` | Crypto / Finance |
| Plaid | `plaid` | Fintech / Open Banking |
| Ramp | `ramp` | Fintech / Spend Management |

## Tesla

Tesla is a **single-tenant** scraper — `companyUrl` and `companySlug` are both ignored; the service always targets `https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/`. Operators don't pass a slug; the single canonical entry below is documented for symmetry with the other plugins and for the directory's auto-discovery tooling. Operators control output volume via `resultsWanted` (cap on listings) and `descriptionDepth` (per-job detail-fetch budget — `'board'` skips details, `'detail-25'` default caps at 25 follow-ups, `'detail-all'` fetches every job).

| Tamara | `tamara` | Fintech / BNPL |
| TrueLayer | `truelayer` | Fintech / Open Banking |

| Culture Amp | `cultureamp` | HR Tech / People Analytics |
| Energage | `energage` | HR Tech / Employee Engagement |
| Veriff | `veriff` | Identity / KYC |
| Thoropass | `thoropass` | Security / Compliance |

| PathAI | `pathai` | Healthcare AI / Digital Pathology |
| Found | `found` | SMB Fintech / Business Banking |
| Parsley Health | `parsleyhealth` | Healthcare / Telehealth |
| Neuralink | `neuralink` | Neurotechnology / Brain-Computer Interface |
| CLEAR | `clear` | Identity / Biometric Security |

The OPTIONAL `source-tesla-playwright` companion plugin is opt-in (per Q-028 / FR-13) — operators must manually import `TeslaPlaywrightModule` AND install `playwright` (`npm install playwright && npx playwright install chromium`) to enable the Akamai-bypass path. Both plugins emit jobs against the same single `tesla` slug; the dedup engine collapses cross-plugin duplicates by `externalId` per Spec 003 / FR-3.

## Tips for Finding Company Slugs

### Greenhouse
Visit `boards.greenhouse.io/{company-name}` or check the company's career page source for `greenhouse.io` links.

### Lever
Visit `jobs.lever.co/{company-name}` or check career page source for `lever.co` links.

### Workday
Look at the company's career page URL — it typically contains `{company}.wd{N}.myworkdayjobs.com`.

### Ashby
Visit `jobs.ashbyhq.com/{company-name}` or check the career page source.

### Taleo
Check the career page URL for `taleo.net` — the slug is derived from the company and career section identifiers.

### iCIMS
Check the career page URL for `icims.com` — look for the company portal identifier.

### Phenom
Check if the company's career site uses `jobs.{company}.com` — Phenom-powered sites have a consistent API pattern.

### Avature
Check the career page URL for `*.avature.net` (default tenant) — the slug is the leftmost subdomain. For custom-domain tenants (e.g. `careers.ibm.com`), pass the full URL via the `companyUrl` input override; the plugin handles both.

### Gem
Visit `jobs.gem.com/{slug}` directly. The slug appears in the URL path; multi-word company names use hyphens (e.g. `alex-and-ani`).

### Join.com
Visit `join.com/companies/{slug}`. The slug is the URL path segment after `/companies/`. The plugin then issues a public-API call to fetch the numeric `companyId` automatically.

### General Strategy
1. Go to the company's career page
2. View page source (Ctrl+U)
3. Search for ATS platform domains (greenhouse.io, lever.co, ashbyhq.com, etc.)
4. Extract the slug from the URL pattern
